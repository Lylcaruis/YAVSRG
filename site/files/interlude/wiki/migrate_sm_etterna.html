          <div class="frame text-2xl container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h1 class="text-3xl">Migrating from StepMania or Etterna</h1><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Already play StepMania or Etterna (or both)? This guide will walk you through migrating your songs to Interlude.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">If you encounter any bugs or things that don't look right, feel free to ask in the Discord server.</p></div><div class="frame text-2xl container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h2 class="text-3xl">Step 1: Songs</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4">In Options &gt; Library, there is a tool for linking your existing Songs library to Interlude.<br/>It will first try to auto detect the folder for the respective game, but if that doesn't work you can just link by dropping your <strong>Songs folder</strong> onto the Interlude window <strong>when the menu asks you to.</strong></p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">By linking your libraries instead of fully importing them, audio files and background images are not copied, so the Interlude version of the song library should only be a few MB (saves on drive space if you play both).<br/>There is also an option to automatically import newly added charts whenever Interlude launches.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">It may take a few minutes to complete the import, but it will work in the background and you can play what songs have already been imported.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">You can also download new Etterna packs ingame via the Import screen.</p></div><div class="frame text-2xl container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h2 class="text-3xl">Step 2: Noteskins</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4">With a small bit of knowledge and the <a class="underline" href="noteskins.html">Noteskins guide</a>, you should have no problem porting the vast majority of StepMania/Etterna noteskins to Interlude by renaming files.<br/>In the future there may be a tool to automate or partially automate the process.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Alternatively, there are noteskins available for download from the Import screen - If you use a common skin it may already be there!</p></div><div class="frame text-2xl container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h2 class="text-3xl">Step 3: Scroll speed and audio sync</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4">It's hard to conveniently convert your scroll speed to Interlude, so I recommend eyeballing it.<br/>Under Options &gt; Gameplay &gt; Scroll speed, there is an indicator of what Interlude scroll speed is equal to what osu! scroll speed, but it <strong>is only accurate if your column width is the same in both games</strong> due to how Etterna's scroll speed calculation works.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">On the Level select menu, you can open Practice mode to play a section of the selected song and the game will suggest adjustments to your scroll speed, hitposition, audio offset and visual offset.<br/>If you're used to another game, you should adjust all offsets with the game audio muted at first, and then change audio offset last.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Suggested order to make changes:</p><ul><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Mute game audio while playing a section of a chart in practice mode</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Once scroll speed looks right to you, adjusting hitposition until it looks right</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Once hitposition looks right to you, adjust visual offset if needed</li><li class="ml-8 list-disc">Unmute game audio and continue playing to adjust audio offset as needed</li></ul></div>
