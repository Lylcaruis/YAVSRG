Sometimes one ruleset can be more useful than another, depending on what you're doing!</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Rulesets are available for download ingame via the Imports menu.</p></div><div class="frame text-2xl container flex flex-col mx-auto p-4"><h2 class="text-3xl">Creating a ruleset</h2><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Rulesets are a <code>.json</code> file that you can manually edit with any text editor.
There is currently no documentation for how the file works and users are currently not expected to be creating their own rulesets.</p><p class="leading-8 mb-4">Want to create your own ruleset and need some documentation? Ask in the Discord.</p></div>
