0.7.27.8

A small bug fix update

# New features
- Letterboxing now supports offsets within the monitor in question
  This also applies to windowed mode, so you can have a default position other than the center of the monitor
- Your stats are now synced between your game client and the server
  This is not displayed anywhere yet, but enables various global leaderboards (probably next week)

# Improvements
- Skinning screen will scroll as you enter it so that the selected HUD and Noteskin are always visible
- Delete and context menu hotkeys behave more predictably when navigating scoreboard using keyboard
- Release error bars can be made smaller as well as larger

# Bug fixes
- Fixed some visual issues with the stats screen
- Fixed switching from fullscreen letterbox to fullscreen not working correctly
- Fixed presets not auto-switching if the first song you change to is a different keymode
- Fixed level select not returning to a playlist after continuing it in endless mode
- Fixed moving average weight slider clipping out of bounds
- Fixed option to delete a leaderboard score showing up (it didn't do anything)
