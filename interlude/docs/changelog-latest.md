0.7.27.14
====

Small update while I work on more pattern, difficulty and performance analysis improvements

# New features
- You can now set a custom frame cap via the performance settings  
  Useful for people that have various issues with Smart Cap or for more reliable recording/streaming
- New 'Column Swap' mod that lets you put columns in a custom order  
  UI to be improved further in a future update

# Improvements
- Smart frame cap now uses VSync on Intel hardware, again this change will be used to study the Intel-Graphics-Only crashes
- Stats graphs now open switched to the keymode you're playing
- Judgement percentages now show on score screen, also ratios if you switch to showing more details
- Made a change to the chart/score databases that should make them less prone to locking

# Bug fixes
- Fixed a visual issue with LN tails under certain circumstances
- Fixed an issue where the wrong judgement would be awarded for LN releases on Quaver rulesets
- Fixed sporadic 'Server error' messages showing ingame
