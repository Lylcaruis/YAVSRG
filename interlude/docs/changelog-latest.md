This update changes many engine things, enjoy
Many more songs have now been given score leaderboards since last update (and more on the way)

# New features
- Game window opens faster, then has a loading screen while the rest of the game loads
- Audio engine should no longer have any offset drift at all across rates, in general offset will feel much more consistent now
- Screenshots automatically get copied to the clipboard when taken
- Screenshots do not include notifications/other screenshot popups in the image when taken
- CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F1 crashes your game and opens the log, for easier bug reporting
- Song audio crossfades out/in when switching song instead of a hard cut
- Change column filters on score screen with number keys
- Timestamps are shown when hovering over the score graph
- Color pickers in all options menus are now an entire page instead of a small box

# Bug fixes
- Potential fix for various crashes and graphical glitches on Intel HD Graphics
- Fixed cloning rulesets and then editing the clone sometimes editing the original too
- Fixed bug with creating new lamps in rulesets that made the ordering unclear
- HUD editor now unpauses song if it was paused on entering
- Fixed issues with osu! Skin parsing when a decimal is used where an integer expected
- Song now correctly fades out during the transition into replay mode
